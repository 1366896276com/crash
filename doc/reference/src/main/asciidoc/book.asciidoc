CRaSH reference guide
=====================
Julien Viet <julien@julienviet.com>

The Common Reusable SHell (CRaSH) deploys in a Java runtime and provides interactions with the JVM.
Commands are written in Groovy and can be developped at runtime making the extension of the shell very easy
with fast development cycle.
