Cookbook.


= Basic =


== How can I run CRaSH ?

See documentation : http://www.crashub.org/doc.html#running

== How can I connect Crash to a JVM ? ==

See documentation Connection in Shell Usage chapter  http://www.crashub.org/doc.html#d5e219


= Developping commands =

== Create your first command ==

You can create ac command dynamicaly without restarting CRaSH.

=== Run CRaSH ===

cd $CRASH_HOME/bin
./crash.sh
Type help at prompt

You will see something like :

 Try one of these commands with the -h or --help switch:

NAME      DESCRIPTION
clock
dashboard
date      show the current time
env       display the term env
filter
hello
help      provides basic help
java      various java language commands
jdbc      JDBC connection
jmx       Java Management Extensions
jndi      Java Naming and Directory Interface
jpa       Java persistance API
jvm       JVM informations
log       logging commands
man       format and display the on-line manual pages
shell     shell related command
sleep     sleep for some time
sort      Sort a map
system    vm system properties commands
thread    JVM thread commands

=== Add new command ===

cd $CRASH_HOME/cmd
vi test.groovy

Put the following in test.groovy :

for (int i = 0;i < 10;i++) {
  System.out.println("CRaSH is cool !");
}

Note : In this example, we create a command by using Java syntax.
It's because Groovy understand Java Syntax.So you could begin to develop
your command in Java and when you want try cool Groovy stuff.

=== refresh console ===

Type help again at prompt and you will see test command
