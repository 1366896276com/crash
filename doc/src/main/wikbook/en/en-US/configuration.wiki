= Configuration properties =

CRaSH is configured by a set of properties, those properties are defined in a configuration file. In the war file packaging,
the configuration file can be found under ///WEB-INF/crash/crash.properties// file of the war. Configuration can be overriden
by Java Virtual Machine system properties by using the same property name.

{{note}}
CRaSH properties are always prefixed by the //crash.// value
{{/note}}

= Change the SSH server key =

The key can be changed by replacing the file //WEB-INF/sshd/hostkey.pem//. Alternatively you can configure the server
to use an external file by using the //crash.ssh.keypath// parameter in the //crash.properties//. Uncomment the corresponding
property and change the path to the key file.

{{code}}
#crash.ssh.keypath=/path/to/the/key/file
{{/code}}

= Change the ports of the telnet or SSH server =

The ports of the server are parameterized by the //crash.ssh.port// and //crash.telnet.port// parameters in the //crash.properties// file

{{code}}
# SSH configuration
crash.ssh.port=2000
{{/code}}

{{code}}
# Telnet configuration
crash.telnet.port=5000
{{/code}}

= Remove the telnet or SSH access =

* to remove the telnet access, remove the jar file in the //WEB-INF/lib/crsh.shell.telnet-$[crash.version].jar// .
* to remove the SSH access, remove the jar file in the //WEB-INF/lib/crsh.shell.ssh-$[crash.version].jar// .

= Configure the shell default message =

The ///WEB-INF/crash/commands/base/login.groovy// file contains two closures that are evaluated each time a message is required

* The ##prompt## closure returns the prompt message
* The ##welcome## closure returns the welcome message

Those closure can be customized to return different messages.
