=== Exporting a node ===

It is possible to export a node as an nt file of the same workspace with the ##exportnode## command. Then it is
usually possible to access the nt file from webdav.

{{screen}}
[/]% exportnode gadgets /gadgets.xml
The node has been exported
{{/screen}}

=== Importing a node ===

It is possible to import a node from an nt file located in the workspace with the ##importnode## command.

{{screen}}
[/]% importnode /gadgets.xml /
Node imported
{{/screen}}

=== Adding a mixin to a node ===

The ##addmixin## command adds a mixin to an existing node.

{{screen}}
[/gadgets]% addmixin . mix:versionable
{{/screen}}

{{note}}
##addmixin## is a ##<Node,Void>## command adding the specified mixin to the consumed nodes.
{{/note}}

=== Configuring the node security ===

{{warning}}This is command is only available for eXo JCR{{/warning}}

The ##setperm## commands configures the security of a node based on [[eXo JCR access control>>http://wiki.exoplatform.com/xwiki/bin/view/JCR/Access%20Control]].
When a node is protected by access control, it owns a mixin called ##exo:privilegeable## that contains a ##exo:permissions##
property, for instance:

{{screen}}
[/production]% ls
/production
+-properties
| +-jcr:primaryType: nt:unstructured
| +-jcr:mixinTypes: [exo:privilegeable]
| +-exo:permissions: [*:/platform/administrators read,*:/platform/administrators add_node,*:/platform/administrators set_property,*:/platform/administrators remove]
+-children
| +-/production/app:gadgets
| +-/production/app:applications
| +-/production/mop:workspace
{{/screen}}

You can alter the node permission list with the ##setperm## command:

{{screen}}
[/production]% setperm -i *:/platform/mygroup -a read -a add_node /
Node /production updated to [read,add_node]
{{/screen}}

You can also remove a permission by using the -r option.

{{screen}}
[/production]% setperm -i *:/platform/mygroup -r add_node /
Node /production updated to [read]
{{/screen}}

{{warning}}
The ##setperm## command will add automatically the ##exo:privilegeable## mixin on the node when it is missing.
{{/warning}}

{{note}}
##setperm## is a ##<Node,Void>## command altering the security of the consumed node stream.
{{/note}}


=== Disconnecting ===

The ##disconnect## command disconnect from the repository.

== SCP usage ==

Secure copy can be used to import or export content. The username/password prompted by the SSH server will be used
for authentication against the repository when the import or the export is performed.

=== Export a JCR node ===

The following command will export the node ///gadgets// in the repository //portal-system//
of the portal container //portal//:

{{screen}}
scp -P 2000 root@localhost:portal:portal-system:/production/app:gadgets .
{{/screen}}

The node will be exported as //app_gadgets.xml//.

Note that the portal container name is used for GateIn. If you do omit it, then the root container will be used.

=== Import a JCR node ===

The following command will reimport the node:

{{screen}}
scp -P 2000 gadgets.xml root@localhost:portal:portal-system/production/app:gadgets
{{/screen}}

The exported file format use the JCR system view. You can get more information about that in the JCR specification.
