=== Exporting a node ===

It is possible to export a node as an nt file of the same workspace with the ##exportnode## command. Then it is
usually possible to access the nt file from webdav.

{{screen}}
[/]% exportnode gadgets /gadgets.xml
The node has been exported
{{/screen}}

=== Importing a node ===

It is possible to import a node from an nt file located in the workspace with the ##importnode## command.

{{screen}}
[/]% importnode /gadgets.xml /
Node imported
{{/screen}}


== SCP usage ==

Secure copy can be used to import or export content. The username/password prompted by the SSH server will be used
for authentication against the repository when the import or the export is performed.

=== Export a JCR node ===

The following command will export the node ///gadgets// in the repository //portal-system//
of the portal container //portal//:

{{screen}}
scp -P 2000 root@localhost:portal:portal-system:/production/app:gadgets .
{{/screen}}

The node will be exported as //app_gadgets.xml//.

Note that the portal container name is used for GateIn. If you do omit it, then the root container will be used.

=== Import a JCR node ===

The following command will reimport the node:

{{screen}}
scp -P 2000 gadgets.xml root@localhost:portal:portal-system/production/app:gadgets
{{/screen}}

The exported file format use the JCR system view. You can get more information about that in the JCR specification.
