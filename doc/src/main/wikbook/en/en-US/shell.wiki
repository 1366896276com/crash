= Running CRaSH =

CRaSH provides has various ways to be started, it can even be easily embedded.

== Web archive deployment ==

CRaSH can use a standard web archive to be deployed in a web container. The war file is used for its packaging capabilities
and triggering the CRaSH life cycle start/stop. In this mode CRaSH has two packaging available:

* A __core__ war file found under //deploy/core/crash.war// provides the base CRaSH functionnalities.
* A __gatein__ war file found under //deploy/gatein/crash.war// provides additional Java Content Repository (JCR)
 features but deploys only in a GateIn server (Tomcat or JBoss). It extends the core packaging and adds
** JCR browsing and interactions
** SCP support for JCR import and export

You have to copy the //crash.war// in the appropriate server, regardless of the packaging used.

== Standalone mode ==

The standalone mode allows you to run CRaSH from the command line directly. It provides the same functionality as the
war deployment but does not require a web container as it runs its own virtual machine. The directory __crash__ directory
in the application contains the standalone distribution.

The bin directory ///crash/bin// can be added to the system path, it contains the //crash.sh// script that will start
the standalone mode, for instance you can set it up this way:

{{screen}}
> export PATH=/.../crash/bin:$PATH
> crash.sh

Let's review quickly what you can find in standalone crash:

* The //bin// directory contains the //crash.sh// script and the standalone crash jar file
* The //conf// directory contains the JVM logging configuration //logging.properties//
* The //cmd// directory contains the commands that will be available in crash by default it contains a few example commands
* The //lib// directory contains the various libraries used by crash, you should place additional jar files there

== Attach mode ==

The attach mode allows you to attach CRaSH to a JVM located on the same host with the attach API provided by the Hotspot
JVM. It works thanks to the standalone mode, the main difference is when you run the command line you can specify a
process id of a JVM and CRaSH will hook into the targetted JVM, let's see quickly an example of how to use it

In this example we will attach crash to the Test JVM. We obtained the Test JVM PID thanks to the //jps// command that belongs
to the Java Platform. During this mode the commands are executed in the target JVM.

= Shell usage =

== Connection ==

You need to connect using telnet, SSH to use the shell, there is a third special mode using the JVM input and output.

=== Telnet access ===

Telnet connection is done on port 5000:

{{screen}}
(! 520)-> telnet localhost 5000
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

The ##bye## command disconnect from the shell.

=== SSH access ===

SSH connection is done on port 2000 with the password **//crash//**:

The ##bye## command disconnect from the shell.

=== Native access ===

A third mode is available for standalone CRaSH usage because it uses the JVM native input and output. When you are using
it, CRaSh will be available just after the JVM is launched.

== Features ==

* Line edition: the current line can be edited via left and right arrow keys
* History: the key up and key down enable history browsing
* Quoting: simple quotes or double quotes allow to insert blanks in command options and arguments, for instance
//"old boy"// or //'old boy'//. One quote style can quote another, like //"ol' boy"//.
* Completion: an advanced completion system is available

= Command usage =

== Getting basic help ==

The ##help## command will display the list of known commands by the shell.

{{screen}}
[/]% help
% help
Try one of these commands with the -h or --help switch:

  cd               changes the current node
  commit           saves changes
  consume          collects a set of nodes
  cp               copy a node to another
  env              display the term env
  exportworkspace  Export a workspace on the file system (experimental)
  fail             Fails
  help             provides basic help
  importworkspace  Import a workspace from the file system (experimental)
  invoke           Invoke a static method
  log              logging commands
  ls               list the content of a node

== Command line usage ==

The basic CRaSH usage is like any shell, you just type a command with its options and arguments. However it is possible
 to compose commands and create powerful combinations.

=== Basic command usage ===

Typing the command followed by options and arguments will do the job

{{screen}}
% ls /
...
{{/screen}}

=== Command help display ===

Any command help can be displayed by using the -h argument:

{{screen}}
% ls -h
usage: ls [-h | --help] [-h | --help] [-d | --depth] path

   [-h | --help]  command usage
   [-h | --help]  command usage
   [-d | --depth] Print depth
   path           the path of the node content to list
{{/screen}}

In addition of that, commands can have a complete manual that can be displayed thanks to the ##man## command:

{{screen}}
% man ls
NAME
       ls - list the content of a node

SYNOPSIS
       ls [-h | --help] [-h | --help] [-d | --depth] [-d | --depth] path

DESCRIPTION
       The ls command displays the content of a node. By default it lists the content of the current node, however it also
       accepts a path argument that can be absolute or relative.

       [/]% ls

=== Advanced command usage ===

A CRaSH command is able to consume and produce a stream of object, allowing complex interactions between commands
where they can exchange stream of compatible objets. Most of the time, JCR nodes are the objects exchanged by the
commands but any command is free to produce or consume any type.

By default a command that does not support this feature does not consumer or produce anything. Such commands usually
inherits from the ##org.crsh.command.ClassCommand## class that does not care about it. If you look at this class
you will see it extends the the ##org.crsh.command.BaseCommand##.

More advanced commands inherits from ##org.crsh.command.BaseCommand## class that specifies two generic types ##<C>##
and ##<P>##:

* ##<C>## is the type of the object that the command consumes
* ##<P>## is the type of the object that the command produces

The command composition provides two operators:

* The pipe operator **|** allows to stream a command output stream to a command input stream
* The distribution operator **+** allows to distribute an input stream to several commands and to combine the output stream
of several commands into a single stream.

=== Connecting a ##<Void,Node>## command to a ##<Node,Void>## command through a pipe ===

{{example title="Remove all nt:unstructed nodes"}}
{{screen}}
% select * from nt:unstructed | rm
{{/screen}}
{{/example}}

=== Connecting a ##<Void,Node>## command to two ##<Node,Void>## commands through a pipe ===

{{example title="Update the security of all nt:unstructed nodes"}}
{{screen}}
% select * from nt:unstructured | setperm -i any -a read + setperm -i any -a write
{{/screen}}
{{/example}}

=== Connecting two ##<Void,Node>## command to a ##<Node,Void>## commands through a pipe ==

{{example title="Add the mixin mix:referenceable to any node of type nt:file or nt:folder"}}
{{screen}}
% select * from nt:file + select * from nt:folder | addmixin mix:referenceable
{{/screen}}
{{/example}}

=== Mixed cases ===

When a command does not consume a stream but is involved in a distribution it will not receive any stream but will
be nevertheless invoked.

Likewise when a command does not produce a stream but is involved in a distribution, it will not produce anything but
will be nevertheless invoked.
