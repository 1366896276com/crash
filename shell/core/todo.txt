- investigate https://code.google.com/p/sshxcute/ an java ssh client for ssh unit testing
- seems intersting for packaging http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=introduction&file=background
- write AbstractTerm unit tests
- write IO tests
- write pipe consistency
- more Conversion, for instance String -> JCR node from current session
- ability to describe a meta argument like, maybe just a convention with "description" is fine
@Option(names=["l","level"],completer=org.crsh.cmdline.EnumCompleter)
@interface LevelOpt {
  String description() default "";
}

- standalone ?
- documentation generation from commands would be just great, like a servlet :-)
- make port configurable
- make an installer


- support "\ " (read http://www.tuteurs.ens.fr/unix/shell/commande.html)
